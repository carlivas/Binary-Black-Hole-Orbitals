# üï≥Ô∏è Binary Black Hole Orbits

This project is a numerical simulation of relativistic binary black hole systems. It was conducted as my bachelor's project at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with R√∂gnvaldur Konr√°√∞ Helgason.

## üìú Abstract
The post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion is a method for correcting Newtonian equations of motion based on the effects of Einstein's theory of general relativity. This project numerically simulates scattering and bound state orbits of two massive bodies using first and second-order PM expansions. These simulations are compared with a first-order post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and classical Newtonian orbits. The research explores the advantages of the PM expansion and further develops intuition for the behavior of its equations of motion.

## üíª Methodology
- Derivations and Simulations: Hamiltonian equations of motion (EOM) for the 1PM and 2PM Hamiltonians were derived and simulated. For comparison, the EOM of the 1PN expansion and a classical Newtonian system were also simulated.
- Parameter Analysis: Key parameters affected by General Relativity, such as periastron precession and the scattering angle, were analyzed by comparing the simulations with analytical expressions.
- Focus on Ultra-Relativistic Regimes: The project focused on numerically solving the two-body problem in General Relativity, with a particular emphasis on systems in ultra-relativistic regimes where the PN expansion is less effective.

## üî¨ Results
The research found that the performance of the post-Minkowskian expansion surpasses that of the post-Newtonian expansion in ultra-relativistic regimes. This work could be expanded upon at higher orders of the expansions to further develop simulations of gravitational waveforms from binary systems, which are crucial for theoretical and experimental gravitational wave research.
